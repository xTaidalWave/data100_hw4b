        <p>We will start our exploration by looking at how much content each streaming service
            provided from 2017-2021, keeping in mind the advent of the COVID pandemic in early
            2020. We will then take a closer look at this content, determining how many movies
            versus TV series were offered.</p>

            <h2>How many different things can we watch?</h2>
            <p>Both Netflix and Hulu present a variety of movies and TV shows, including those
                created by the streaming services themselves, and others that were created
                elsewhere and re-broadcast.</p>

            <p>Netflix content has been 1200 offerings or more since 2017, peaking with over 2000
                items in 2019 and then declining during the pandemic years, resulting in
                approximately 1500 programs in 2021. Hulu's offerings have steadily increased since
                2017, when they had only 200 offerings. In contrast to Netflix, Hulu's programming
                increased in 2020 and 2021, with over 1000 programs available in 2021.</p>

                <h2>Netflix shows more movies, and Hulu shows more TV (or does it?)</h2>
                <p>As we saw in the introduction, Netflix started out as a movie service, and Hulu
                    started out as a way for users to watch TV.</p>
                <img src="Presenting Data 24'/img/movies_vs_tv.png" alt="Movies vs TV for Netflix and Hulu" width="50%">
                <p>Netflix started as a movie service, and has continued to provide more movies than
                    TV series. Interestingly, from 2017 to 2021, Huluâ€™s distribution of content has
                    changed from predominantly TV to a dominance of movies. Is Hulu turning into
                    Netflix?</p>
